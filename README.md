## Overview

This is a group project that was completed in CSCE 247, Software Engineering. The assignment was to create a degree auditing software for students, professors, and advisors to use. The program allows users to log in and depending if they are a faculty member or student they will see two different screens. The overall purpose is for users to be able to keep track of their degree progress. Showing users the classes they have taken and the classes they need to take to complete their degree and any added minors.
